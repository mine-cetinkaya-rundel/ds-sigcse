# Survey email

Dear workshop participants,

Thank you for your interest in the "Computing infrastructure and curriculum design for introductory data science" workshop at SIGCSE.

A quick reminder for your calendars: The workshop will be held on Wednesday, February 27, 7:00 pm - 10:00 pm at Hyatt: Greenway F (2nd floor).

I will be sending you two emails prior to the workshop. The first one (this one) is for me to learn a little bit about you. Please take the pre-workshop survey at https://goo.gl/forms/O4Yvu5iWzk6Su0743 so that I can get a better sense of your background,  expectations, and personal learning goals for the workshop. This should take no more than 5 minutes of your time, if that.

The second one will come over the weekend and will contain setup instructions. We should be able to get you up and running quickly even if you do none of the pre-workshop setup (as long as the conference WiFi cooperates), but I'll be sending backup instructions just in case.

Looking forward to meeting you all next week.

Best,
Mine
