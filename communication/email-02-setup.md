# Survey email

Dear workshop participants,

Thank you again for your interest in the "Computing infrastructure and curriculum design for introductory data science" workshop at SIGCSE.

If you haven't yet done so, please take a moment to complete the pre-workshop survey at https://goo.gl/forms/O4Yvu5iWzk6Su0743.

Please make sure to bring a fully charged laptop with you to the workshop. 

In this workshop we will be coding in R via the RStudio IDE. If the conference WiFi cooperates we will do this in the cloud via rstudio.cloud. I will purposefully hold off instructions for this so that you can experience students' day one experience in the class.

However, our backup is going to be running RStudio locally. Instructions for this option can be found at https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/ds-sigcse#pre-workshop-instructions. ()

Looking forward to seeing you all on Wednesday (February 27, 7:00 pm - 10:00 pm at Hyatt: Greenway F, 2nd floor).

Best,
Mine
