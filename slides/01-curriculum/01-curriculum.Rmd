## Goals

- Outline a curriculum for an introductory data science course 
- Discuss pedagogical decisions that go into the choice of topics and concepts: 
  - Programming language (R) and syntax (primarily tidyverse)
  - Emphasis on literate programming for reproducibility (with R Markdown)

---

## Exercise: `01-unvotes`

- Go to [rstd.io/sigcse19-cloud](https://rstd.io/sigcse19-cloud)
- Start the assignment titled `01 - UN Votes` and open the document called `01-unvotes.Rmd`

```{r out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cloud-assignment.png")
```

- Now you get to run your (possibly first) R code! Knit the document, view the
plot you produced, and complete the two tasks

.large[
An introductory data science course that

<br>

`r emo::ji("hatching_chick")` &nbsp; assumes no background  
`r emo::ji("mag")` &nbsp; focuses on EDA + modeling & inference + modern computing  
`r emo::ji("woman_technologist")` &nbsp; uses R as the programming languag  
`r emo::ji("busts_in_silhouette")` &nbsp; requires reproducibility  
`r emo::ji("two_women_holding_hands")` &nbsp; emphasizes collaboration + effective communication

## Unit 2 - Making rigorous conclusions

```{r out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/topic-flow-2.png")
```

- Modeling and statistical inference for making data based conclusions
- Building, interpreting, and selecting models, visualizing interaction effects, and prediction and model validity. 
- Statistical inference via simulation (randomization + bootstrapping)

---

## Unit 3 - Looking forward

```{r out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/topic-flow-3.png")
```

- Whatever you like!
- Independent modules that instructors can choose to include in their introductory data science curriculum depending on how much time they have left in the semester.
- Interactive reporting and visualizaiton with Shiny, text analysis, Bayesian inference, etc.

## start with`r emo::ji("cake")` = start with `r emo::ji("bar_chart")`

- **Familiarity:** Students have likely previously encountered data visualizations
- **Intuition:** Interpretation of a data visualization, even a complex one on a dataset with a familiar context, requires little to no instruction
- **Ease:** It's not necessarily easy to make visualizations, but it can be easier for students to catch their own mistakes than when doing data manipulation or building models
- **Shift in flow:** Teach data science first, then programming, i.e. delay introducing important programming basics (e.g. variable types, data structures)

```{r}

### Specify the model

```{r}

---

### Generate bootstrap samples

```{r}

  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap")  #<<

### Summarise CI bounds

Using syntax students are already familiar with from `dplyr`:

```{r}
evals %>%
  specify(score ~ gender) %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female")) %>%
  summarise(l = quantile(stat, 0.025), u = quantile(stat, 0.975)) #<<
```
