Interested in teaching introductory data science? running your course on GitHub, and doing so efficiently? what first exposure to computing with R might look like? what the tidyverse is? If your answer is yes to any of these, this workshop is for you! We will showcase and discuss the pedagogical considerations behind the introductory data science curriculum presented in Data Science in a Box (datasciencebox.org), get hands on practice with tooling, and share a complete set of open source course materials, including teacher facing documentation and student facing learning resources and assessments.

## Abstract

The goal of this workshop is to equip educators with concrete information on content and infrastructure for designing and painlessly running a modern data science course. This is a three-part workshop. Part 1 will outline a curriculum for an introductory data science course and discuss pedagogical decisions that go into the choice of topics and concepts, programming language (R) and syntax (primarily tidyverse), emphasis on literate programming for reproducibility (with R Markdown). Part 2 will discuss infrastructure choices around teaching data science with R: RStudio as an integrated development environment, cloud-based access with RStudio Cloud and Server, version control with Git, and collaboration with GitHub. Part 3 will focus on classroom management on GitHub (with ghclass) and automated feedback with continuous integration tools (e.g. Wercker). Workshop attendees will work through several exercises from the course and get first-hand experience with using the tool-chains and techniques described above. All workshop content, including teacher facing documentation and student facing course materials, will also be available to participants via datasciencebox.org.
